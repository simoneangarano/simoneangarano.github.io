<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Simone Angarano</strong>, and I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at <a href="www.polito.it">Politecnico di Torino</a> . I am a member of the AI section of the Interdepartmental Center for Service Robotics <a href="https://pic4ser.polito.it/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PIC4SeR</a>, where my focus is on creating <strong>efficient deep learning models for robot perception and control</strong>. In my research, particular attention is given to key aspects of real-world applications like <strong>generalization</strong> and <strong>robustness</strong>. Moreover, the constraints imposed by the application field in terms of latency and power consumption are considered. I spent the last year at the <a href="https://vita-group.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin</a>, working on efficient foundation vision models. In the previous years, I had the opportunity to work on different research projects spanning tasks like image classification, <strong>human action recognition</strong>, <strong>super-resolution</strong>, instance segmentation, path planning, navigation, and localization. Solving these tasks, I got passionate about domain and sim-to-real generalization, <strong>model compression</strong>, and <strong>knowledge distillation</strong>. I also collaborated on various projects with <strong>companies</strong>, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning solutions to solve real-world tasks in <strong>smart agriculture</strong>, space exploration, and <strong>domestic assistance</strong>.</p> </body></html>
