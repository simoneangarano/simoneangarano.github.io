Hi! I'm <span style="color:#0076df">Simone Angarano</span>., and I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at [Politecnico di Torino](www.polito.it). I am a member of the AI section of the Interdepartmental Center for Service Robotics [PIC4SeR](https://pic4ser.polito.it/), where my focus is on creating **efficient deep learning models for robot perception and control**. In my research, particular attention is given to key aspects of real-world applications like **generalization** and **robustness**. Moreover, the constraints imposed by the application field in terms of latency, power consumption, and weight are always considered. In the past two years, I had the opportunity to work on different research projects spanning tasks like image classification, **human action recognition**, **super-resolution**, instance segmentation, path planning, navigation, and localization. Solving these tasks, I got passionate about domain and sim-to-real generalization, **model optimization**, and **knowledge distillation**. I also collaborated on various projects with **companies** like Baker Hughes, Edison, Comau, Accenture, Reply, Thales, and Ferrero. I really enjoy working with companies and leveraging state-of-the-art AI deep learning solutions to solve real-world problems such as **smart agriculture**, space exploration, autonomous warehouses, and **domestic assistance**.
