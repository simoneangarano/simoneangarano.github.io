I'm a Ph.D. student in Electrical, Electronics, and Communications Engineering and member of the Interdepartmental Center for Service Robotics at Politecnico di Torino [PIC4SeR](https://pic4ser.polito.it/). At the same university, I achieved a Bachelor's Degree in Electronic Engineering in 2018 and a Master's Degree in Mechatronic Engineering in 2020, presenting the thesis "Deep Learning Methodologies for UWB Ranging Error Compensation". My research focuses on Deep Learning for robotic applications, spanning computer vision, navigation, and control. In my work, particular attention is also given to model optimization for real-time applications and edge AI.
