This is a companion page for my Ph.D. thesis, where I hope to publish additional findings, considerations, and updates that touch upon the topics we treated here.
For now, this page is assumed to be a static short summary of the thesis. I will later convert it to a collection of appendices and complements, so that I can keep expanding this already quite bulky work with new discoveries, readings, and considerations on efficient and robust AI.

**Appendix A - [BabyAgent: Self-supervised Learning Beyond Internet Data](https://simoneangarano.github.io/babyagent)**

I hope you appreciate it! Do not hesitate to contact me for comments, suggestions, and feedback on the thesis.

> _Now far ahead the Road has gone,_  
> _And I must follow, if I can,_  
> _Pursuing it with eager feet,_  
> _Until it joins some larger way_  
> _Where many paths and errands meet._  
> _And whither then? I cannot say._
